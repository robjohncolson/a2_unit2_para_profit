================================================================================
PERIOD A SCHEDULE
Status: Already completed candy auction and initial Desmos plotting
================================================================================

OPENING (10 minutes)
--------------------
1. Vocabulary Review via Blooket (8-10 min)
   - Navigate to Blooket link above
   - Game mode suggestions: Tower Defense or Gold Quest
   - Key terms: Revenue, Demand, Fixed Cost, Variable Cost, Profit, Break-Even
   - NOTE: Let students know these terms will be critical for today

2. Quick Recap (2 min)
   - "Last class, we ran our candy auction and plotted demand data"
   - "Today, we're converting that to revenue and finding the optimal price"

MAIN ACTIVITY (30-35 minutes)
------------------------------
Distribute: WKS_Auction_to_Revenue_Analysis.pdf (+ Spanish version)

1. Part 1-2: Data Transfer (5 min)
   - Students copy their auction data from last class
   - Fill in Price and Quantity Demanded columns
   - NOTE: Walk around to verify everyone has their data

2. Part 3: Calculate Revenue (5-7 min)
   - Guide calculation: Revenue = Price × Quantity
   - Have students identify highest revenue point
   - TECH: Project example calculation on board

3. Part 4: Desmos Revenue Graph (8-10 min)
   - Open new Desmos table (or modify existing)
   - Enter Price (x₁) and Revenue (y₁) data
   - Students should see parabolic shape forming
   - NOTE: Help struggling students with Desmos interface

4. Part 5: Quadratic Regression (7-8 min)
   - Type in Desmos: y_1 ~ a*x_1^2 + b*x_1 + c
   - Record equation as I(p) = ap² + bp + c
   - Discuss why a is negative (parabola opens down)

5. Part 6: Find Vertex (5-7 min)
   - Click on maximum point in Desmos (graphical method)
   - Calculate using x = -b/(2a) (algebraic method)
   - Verify both methods give same answer
   - Interpret as "optimal price for maximum revenue"

CLOSING (5 minutes)
-------------------
1. Business Interpretation
   - Complete Part 6, Step 9-10 if time allows
   - Write 2-3 sentence business recommendation

2. Preview Next Class
   - "Next time: Apply this to real local businesses"
   - "You'll choose between Golden Monkey, Mandee's, or Yas Chicken"
   - Collect worksheets or have students keep for reference

================================================================================
PERIOD F SCHEDULE
Status: Need to complete Desmos plotting from auction data
================================================================================

DECISION POINT
--------------
Do you have the original auction papers from last class?
- YES → Follow Path A below
- NO → Follow Path B below (re-run quick auction)

OPENING (10 minutes)
--------------------
1. Vocabulary Review via Blooket (8-10 min)
   - Same link as Period A
   - Consider different game mode to keep it fresh
   - Emphasize: Demand, Revenue, Profit, Variable Cost

PATH A: If You Have Original Papers (35 minutes)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Reconstruct Data Table (5 min)
   - Have students find their auction papers
   - Create Price vs. Quantity Demanded table on board
   - Students copy into notebooks

2. Initial Desmos Plot (7-8 min)
   - Open Desmos Calculator
   - Create table: Price (x₁) vs. Quantity Demanded (y₁)
   - Observe demand curve pattern
   - NOTE: This completes what Period A did last class

3. Distribute Worksheet & Continue (20-23 min)
   - Hand out WKS_Auction_to_Revenue_Analysis.pdf
   - Follow same sequence as Period A (Parts 3-6)
   - Calculate revenue, plot revenue curve, find regression, identify vertex

PATH B: If Papers Missing (35 minutes)
---------------------------------------
1. Quick Re-Run Auction (10 min)
   - Announce: "We'll quickly recreate our data"
   - Run 5 rounds with different prices
   - Suggested prices: $0.50, $1.00, $1.50, $2.00, $2.50
   - Record on board: Round, Price, Total Quantity Bought
   - NOTE: Groups can buy multiple candies per round

2. Immediate Desmos Entry (5 min)
   - Students enter data directly into Desmos
   - Create Price vs. Quantity scatterplot
   - Should see downward trend (demand curve)

3. Distribute Worksheet & Continue (20 min)
   - Hand out WKS_Auction_to_Revenue_Analysis.pdf
   - Move through Parts 3-6 as time allows
   - Priority: Get through revenue calculation and graphing

TEACHING TIPS & TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Common Issues & Solutions
-------------------------
• Desmos won't do regression
  - Make sure to use tilde (~) not equals
  - Check that x₁ and y₁ match table column names
  - Try: y1 ~ a*x1^2 + b*x1 + c

• Students getting different vertex values
  - Rounding differences are OK
  - Emphasize both methods (graphical & algebraic) should be close
  - Use this as teaching moment about precision

• Negative revenue values
  - Check multiplication: Price × Quantity
  - Revenue should always be positive
  - Common error: subtracting instead of multiplying

• Spanish-speaking students need help
  - Distribute Spanish version alongside English
  - Pair with bilingual student if possible
  - Key terms: Ingreso (Revenue), Demanda (Demand), Precio (Price)

Key Questions to Ask Students
------------------------------
• "Why does revenue go down if price is too high OR too low?"
• "What does the vertex represent in business terms?"
• "How would this change if we cared about profit instead of revenue?"
• "Could we use this same method for the school cafeteria?"

CHECKLIST FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

Before Class
------------
□ Blooket game loaded and tested
□ Copies of WKS_Auction_to_Revenue_Analysis.pdf (English)
□ Copies of WKS_Auction_to_Revenue_Analysis_Spanish.pdf
□ Desmos calculator bookmarked on class computers
□ Example calculations ready for projection

Materials per Student
---------------------
□ Worksheet (English or Spanish version)
□ Calculator (phone or physical)
□ Access to computer for Desmos
□ Previous auction data (Period A) or blank paper (Period F)

Learning Goals
--------------
□ Students can calculate revenue from price and quantity
□ Students can create and interpret a revenue parabola
□ Students can find optimal price using vertex
□ Students can explain the business meaning of their findings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEXT CLASS PREVIEW: Students will select a local business (Golden Monkey,
Mandee's, or Yas Chicken) and begin analyzing real pricing data using these
same techniques!
