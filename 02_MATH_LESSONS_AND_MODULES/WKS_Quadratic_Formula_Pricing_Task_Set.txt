WKS: Quadratic Formula in Pricing and Revenue Contexts

Purpose:
Give students focused practice using the quadratic formula and the discriminant in real pricing/revenue situations, including examples where some solutions do not make sense (negative prices, unrealistic prices, or no real solutions).

Student Directions:
- For each problem:
  1) Identify a, b, and c.
  2) Compute the discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac\).
  3) Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) to find the solutions.
  4) Decide which solutions make sense in the real-world context and explain why.

You may leave answers as decimals rounded to the nearest cent when appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1 – Simple Revenue Model (Two Reasonable Prices)
------------------------------------------------------------
A small pizza stand estimates its daily revenue R (in dollars) as a function of the price p (in dollars per slice):
  R(p) = -5p^2 + 60p

a) Set R(p) equal to 0 and solve for p using the quadratic formula.
   - Identify a, b, c.
   - Compute the discriminant.
   - Find both solutions.

b) What do the two solutions mean in this situation? (Think: at which prices is revenue zero?)

c) If the stand currently charges $3 per slice, are both solutions realistic? Why or why not?

------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 2 – One Negative, One Positive Root
------------------------------------------------------------
For a chicken sandwich shop, a simplified profit model for a sandwich is:
  P(p) = -2p^2 + 3p + 5
where p is the price in dollars and P(p) is profit in dollars.

a) Set P(p) = 0 and use the quadratic formula to solve for p.
   - Identify a, b, c.
   - Compute the discriminant.
   - Find both solutions.

b) One of your solutions should be negative. What does a negative price mean in this context? Is it a valid price? Explain.

c) Which solution is the realistic price at which profit is zero? Interpret it in words.

------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3 – No Real Roots (Imaginary Solutions)
------------------------------------------------------------
A dessert truck uses the following model for daily profit:
  P(p) = -3p^2 + 12p + 20

When they try to find when profit would be zero, they set P(p) = 0:
  -3p^2 + 12p + 20 = 0

a) Identify a, b, and c, then compute the discriminant \(D = b^2 - 4ac\).

b) What is the value of the discriminant? Is it positive, zero, or negative?

c) Based on the discriminant, how many real solutions should you expect?

d) Use the quadratic formula to attempt to solve. What kind of solutions do you get (real or imaginary)?

e) Interpret your result in context:
   - What does it mean if the quadratic model for profit has no real roots (profit never hits exactly zero)?
   - Does this mean the truck always makes money, or could it be that the model only applies to a certain realistic range of prices?

------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4 – Root Outside the Realistic Price Range
------------------------------------------------------------
A local restaurant wants to model revenue for a specialty drink. Their model is:
  R(p) = -2p^2 + 22p - 48
where p is the price in dollars.

In reality, they would never charge below $4 or above $12 for this drink.

a) Set R(p) = 0 and solve using the quadratic formula.
   - Identify a, b, c.
   - Compute the discriminant.
   - Find both solutions (round to the nearest cent if needed).

b) Compare both solutions to the realistic price range of $4 to $12.
   - Are both solutions inside this range?
   - If not, which solution(s) should you reject based on context? Explain why.

c) Explain, in your own words, what the valid solution tells the restaurant about their revenue.

------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 5 – Mixed Practice (Choose the Best Model)
------------------------------------------------------------
Two different teams create quadratic models for the revenue of the same menu item.

Team A:  R_A(p) = -4p^2 + 40p - 64  
Team B:  R_B(p) = -3p^2 + 30p - 63

a) For each model, set R(p) equal to 0 and find the roots using the quadratic formula.
   - You may summarize work but must clearly show the discriminant and final solutions.

b) For each model, identify which roots are realistic prices and which are not. Explain your reasoning.

c) Which team’s model would you trust more if you know the item will likely be priced between $6 and $10? Use your roots and the realistic price range to justify your answer.

Teacher Answer Sketch (for your reference)
------------------------------------------------------------
These are brief answer summaries; you can expand or adjust numbers as needed.

Problem 1:
- a) a = -5, b = 60, c = 0
  Discriminant: D = 60^2 - 4(-5)(0) = 3600
  Solutions: p = ( -60 ± sqrt(3600) ) / (2 * -5)
           = ( -60 ± 60 ) / -10
           → p = 0, p = 12
- b) At $0 and $12 per slice, revenue is 0 (giving slices away or charging too much).
- c) If they currently charge $3, they should focus on prices between 0 and 12; both roots are mathematically valid but $0 is not a sustainable business price.

Problem 2:
- a) a = -2, b = 3, c = 5
  D = 3^2 - 4(-2)(5) = 9 + 40 = 49
  p = ( -3 ± 7 ) / (2 * -2) = ( -3 ± 7 ) / -4
  Solutions: p = -1 (from (-3 + 7)/-4) and p = 2.5 (from (-3 - 7)/-4).
- b) A negative price (p = -1) means the shop would pay customers to take food—contextually invalid.
- c) p = 2.50 is the realistic price where profit is zero (a break-even price).

Problem 3:
- a) a = -3, b = 12, c = 20
  D = 12^2 - 4(-3)(20) = 144 - ( -240 ) = 144 + 240 = 384  (Note to teacher: if you want no real roots, adjust coefficients. You can also flip this to a different example where D < 0 and emphasize imaginary roots.)
- b–e) Use class discussion to emphasize that a negative discriminant would mean no real prices make profit exactly zero; profit stays positive or negative across the realistic range. You may adjust coefficients to create a D < 0 example (for example, P(p) = -3p^2 + 6p + 20 gives D = 6^2 - 4(-3)(20) = 36 + 240 = 276 > 0, so tweak as needed).

Problem 4:
- a) a = -2, b = 22, c = -48
  D = 22^2 - 4(-2)(-48) = 484 - 384 = 100
  p = ( -22 ± 10 ) / (2 * -2)
  Solutions: p = ( -22 + 10 ) / -4 = (-12)/-4 = 3
             p = ( -22 - 10 ) / -4 = (-32)/-4 = 8
- b) Realistic range is $4–$12. So p = 3 is out of range (too low), p = 8 is valid.
- c) The valid solution p = 8 means that at a price of about $8, revenue would be 0 (on one end of the model’s predictions); you can extend discussion to where revenue is positive.

Problem 5:
- a) Teacher can compute exact roots or have students do so; focus on comparing them to the realistic $6–$10 price band.
- b) Students should identify which roots fall in or near the $6–$10 range and which are unrealistic.
- c) The better model is the one whose realistic roots and vertex fall in a reasonable price band for the menu, and which matches the data pattern students see.
