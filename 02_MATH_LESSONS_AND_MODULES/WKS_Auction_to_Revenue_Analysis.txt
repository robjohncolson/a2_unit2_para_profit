FROM CANDY AUCTION TO MAXIMUM REVENUE
Finding the Sweet Spot: Price Optimization Through Data

Name: _________________ Period: _____ Date: _________

================================================================================
PART 1: REVIEWING OUR AUCTION DATA
================================================================================

Yesterday, we conducted a candy auction where each group could buy as many
candies as they wanted at each price point. Let's organize what we discovered
about DEMAND -- how many candies people wanted to buy at different prices.

Step 1: Record Your Auction Results
------------------------------------
Fill in the table below with the data from our 5 auction rounds:

| Round | Price ($) | Total Quantity Demanded |
|       |           | (candies bought by all groups) |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1     |           |                        |
| 2     |           |                        |
| 3     |           |                        |
| 4     |           |                        |
| 5     |           |                        |

Step 2: Quick Check on Demand
------------------------------
Question: Look at your Price vs. Quantity Demanded data. What pattern do you notice?

This pattern is called the LAW OF DEMAND in economics!

PART 2: FROM DEMAND TO REVENUE
================================================================================

Now comes the business insight: It's not just about how many we sell --
it's about how much money we make!

Step 3: Calculate Revenue
--------------------------
For each round, calculate the REVENUE (total money collected):

        *** Revenue = Price × Quantity Demanded ***

| Round | Price ($) | Quantity Demanded | Revenue ($) |
|       | (copy)    | (copy)           | (calculate: Price × Quantity) |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| 1     |           |                  |             |
| 2     |           |                  |             |
| 3     |           |                  |             |
| 4     |           |                  |             |
| 5     |           |                  |             |

Step 4: The Million Dollar Question
------------------------------------
Looking at your revenue column, which price gave you the HIGHEST REVENUE?

Price: $______    Revenue at that price: $______

================================================================================
PART 3: CREATING THE REVENUE GRAPH IN DESMOS
================================================================================

Step 5: Plot Price vs. Revenue
-------------------------------
a) Open Desmos graphing calculator
b) Create a new table with two columns:
   - Column 1: Label it x₁ (this is Price)
   - Column 2: Label it y₁ (this is Revenue)
c) Enter your 5 data points from the Price and Revenue columns above
d) You should see dots forming a curve!

Sketch what you see:
[Draw a coordinate grid with Price on x-axis and Revenue on y-axis]

================================================================================
PART 4: FINDING THE PERFECT PRICE WITH REGRESSION
================================================================================

Step 6: Fit a Quadratic (Parabola) to Your Data
------------------------------------------------
In Desmos, type this in a new line:

        y₁ ~ ax₁² + bx₁ + c

Desmos will automatically find the best-fitting parabola!
Write the equation it gives you:

Revenue = _____ · Price² + _____ · Price + _____

Record the values Desmos calculated:
• a = _______ (this should be negative -- why?)
• b = _______
• c = _______

================================================================================
PART 5: THE VERTEX -- YOUR OPTIMAL PRICE!
================================================================================

The highest point on your revenue parabola is called the VERTEX.
This tells you the best price to charge!

Step 7: Find the Vertex Graphically
------------------------------------
a) Click on the highest point of your parabola in Desmos
b) Desmos will show you the coordinates: (Price, Revenue)

Vertex from Graph:  Price = $_____  Maximum Revenue = $_____

Step 8: Find the Vertex Using Algebra
--------------------------------------
For any parabola y = ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:

        x = -b/(2a)

Using your values of a and b from Step 6:

Optimal Price = -b/(2a)
              = -(______) / (2 × (______))
              = -(______) / (______)
              = $_______

Check: Does this match what you found graphically?  □ Yes  □ No

PART 6: MAKING BUSINESS SENSE
================================================================================

Step 9: Interpret Your Results
-------------------------------
Complete these sentences based on your analysis:

a) If we price the candy too low (like $_____), we sell a lot but don't make
   much per candy, so our total revenue is _________________.

b) If we price the candy too high (like $_____), we make a lot per candy but
   _________________, so our total revenue is also low.

c) The "sweet spot" price that maximizes our revenue is $_____,
   which would give us a revenue of $_____.

Step 10: Business Recommendation
---------------------------------
Write a 2-3 sentence recommendation to a candy store owner based on your analysis:

================================================================================
EXTENSION QUESTION (if time allows)
================================================================================

Think About It: We found the price that maximizes REVENUE, but businesses care
about PROFIT. What additional information would we need to find the price that
maximizes profit instead?
