Title:
Parabolas for Profit – Market Optimization Report

Student Names: _________________________________
Class / Period: ___________     Date: ___________

Business and Menu Item:
- Local Business: ______________________________________
- Specific Menu Item: _________________________________

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1 – Business and Item Description
------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Describe the business:
- What kind of business is it (pizza, chicken, Cambodian cuisine, etc.)?
- Who are its typical customers (students, families, workers, etc.)?

1.2 Describe your chosen menu item:
- What is it called?
- Why do you think this item is important or interesting to optimize?

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2 – Data Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Data Source:
- Where did your data come from? (teacher-provided synthetic data, survey, price-testing simulation, etc.)
- How many data points did you use?

2.2 Data Table (attach or summarize):
- Include a table or description of:
  - Price (in dollars)
  - Quantity demanded (how many customers buy at that price)

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3 – Revenue and/or Profit Model
------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Define your variables clearly:
- Let x = __________________________ (for example, price in dollars).
- Let R(x) or P(x) = __________________________ (for example, daily revenue in dollars or profit in dollars).

3.2 Show how you built your quadratic model:
- Explain in words:
  - “We used our price and quantity data to calculate revenue (price × quantity) for each row.”
  - “We then used Desmos / a calculator’s regression feature to fit a quadratic model.”

3.3 Write your final quadratic model (regression equation):
- Our model is:
  - R(x) or P(x) = ______________________________________
    (Fill in actual coefficients, rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places.)

3.4 Check: Does the graph match your data?
- Briefly explain why your model seems reasonable (does the curve pass near your data points? does it open down for revenue/profit?).

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4 – Vertex: Optimal Price and Maximum Revenue/Profit
------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Find the vertex:
- Identify a and b in your model y = ax^2 + bx + c:
  - a = ___________    b = ___________    c = ___________

- Use the vertex formula:
  - \(x_v = -\frac{b}{2a} =\) ___________________

- Find the y-value at the vertex:
  - y_v = R(x_v) or P(x_v) = ___________________

4.2 Interpret the vertex in context:
- Write a complete sentence or paragraph explaining:
  - “The vertex of our graph is approximately (x_v, y_v) = (________, ________).”
  - “This means that if the business charges about $________ for this menu item, it will make about $________ in [revenue/profit] from this item (under our model).”

4.3 Connect to decision-making:
- Based on the vertex, what price would you recommend as the “optimal price” for this item?
- Explain why a price lower than this and a price higher than this would both lead to lower revenue/profit.

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 5 – Roots/Zeros: Where Revenue/Profit Hits Zero
------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 Set your model equal to zero:
- Write the equation you are solving:
  - R(x) = 0 or P(x) = 0 → ___________________________________

5.2 Use the quadratic formula:
- Identify a, b, c again:
  - a = ___________    b = ___________    c = ___________

- Compute the discriminant:
  - \(D = b^2 - 4ac =\) ___________________
  - Is D > 0, D = 0, or D < 0?

- Use the quadratic formula:
  - \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\)
  - Show your work and find both solutions (they may be decimals):
    - x₁ = ___________________
    - x₂ = ___________________

5.3 Decide which solutions make sense:
- For each solution, say whether it is:
  - A realistic price for this business (within a reasonable range and positive).
  - Unrealistic because it is negative.
  - Unrealistic because it is far outside the normal price range for this item.
  - Non-real (imaginary) because D < 0.

- Clearly label:
  - “Valid solution(s) in context: ___________________”
  - “Invalid or non-real solution(s): ___________________”

5.4 Explain the meaning (or non-meaning) of the roots:
- If there is a valid root in your price range:
  - Explain what it means (for example, “At about $____, our model predicts zero profit.”).

- If there are no real roots (D < 0):
  - Explain what that means in words (for example, “Our model suggests that profit never hits exactly zero in the realistic price range.”).

- If one root is negative or far outside the realistic range:
  - Explain why you reject it in the real-world context.

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 6 – Final Recommendation to the Business
------------------------------------------------------------
6.1 State your recommended price:
- Based on your model, what price should the business charge for this item?
  - Recommended price: $___________________

6.2 Justify your recommendation:
- Use all three ideas in your explanation:
  - The vertex (optimal price / maximum revenue or profit).
  - Any valid roots (where revenue/profit hits zero, if relevant).
  - Realistic constraints (typical prices for this type of item, customer willingness to pay, etc.).

6.3 Consider trade-offs:
- Are there any reasons the business might choose a slightly higher or lower price than your mathematically optimal price (e.g., competition, marketing, psychological pricing like $9.99)?
- Briefly discuss these trade-offs.

------------------------------------------------------------
Section 7 – Reflection on Quadratic Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------
7.1 Vertex:
- In your own words, what is a vertex of a quadratic function?
- How did the vertex help you make a real business decision in this project?

7.2 Roots/Zeros:
- In your own words, what are the roots (zeros) of a quadratic function?
- In this project, what did the roots (if any) tell you about your pricing model?

7.3 Quadratic Formula and “Nonsense” Solutions:
- Describe a time in this project when:
  - You used the quadratic formula to solve a problem.
  - You got a solution that did not make sense (negative price, imaginary number, or price way outside the menu range).

- Explain:
  - Why that solution was mathematically correct but contextually invalid.
  - What you decided to do with that solution in your final recommendation.

7.4 Big Idea:
- Write 2–3 sentences summarizing what you learned about how quadratics (especially vertex and roots) can be used to make real-world decisions about price and profit.
